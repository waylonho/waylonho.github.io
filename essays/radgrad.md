Getting a job after college is a daunting task for students just getting into the workforce. It’s a big world out there, and especially for computer science students like myself, we always hear that the “possibilities are endless”. But with an ever expanding industry with so much potential, it’s easy to feel lost. RadGrad, an application used by UH Manoa computer science students (and prospective CS students) helps you navigate through these complex waters of finding a job after graduation. The website provides many features including a detailed schedule, a list of future programs that could help improve your coding skills, and CS topics to show interest in that all focus on helping you as a programmer develop skills for the professional world.

## My Experience With RadGrad

So far, my experience using the platform has been pretty interesting. I’ve learned about new topics that I might be interested in, and I’ve definitely heard of new opportunities that I may pursue in the future. The platform almost makes computer science like a social media platform in that you can see other people who are interested in similar topics as you. The various activities you can put on your schedule gives you points that work towards certain stats.

## Why RadGrad is RAD

Let’s talk about the good first. RadGrad’s UI is very user friendly, and there’s a ton of helpful information. There’s so much personalization, and the whole social aspect of the platform makes the job preparation process fun instead of stressful. The circular progress bars easily allow users to visualize their progress and categorize the different activities. I feel like I’m learning more about myself when I explore the topics that are suggested and the opportunities related to those fields. Also, the planner accounts for all your college semesters past and future, so you can see classes and events that you expect to take later. I will give a special mention to the class reviews, as that feature is extremely valuable for students like myself. There are other sites for teacher feedback, but it’s nice to see it implemented into a platform like RadGrad. Overall, RadGrad is helpful and makes an otherwise tedious process a little more enjoyable.

## Why RadGrad is... not too rad

Now, there are some shortcomings about RadGrad that I noticed when trying to complete the new student tutorial. First, although things are user friendly, I felt that there was too much at times. For the planner, the sidebar lists all the activities you selected, but in order to put them onto your schedule you have to drag them individually. When there’s a lot of opportunities, the list becomes a long collection of drop down menus that need to be individually clicked on to see if you’ve already assigned that opportunity to a date or not. Perhaps more organization customization would be handy, like seeing only opportunities that have or haven’t been put on your schedule yet. It’s a minor inconvenience, but overtime if someone wants to change their planner, they might find another design more useful.

## Some Closing Thoughts

In the end, I’m glad to have been introduced to RadGrad. There’s a lot of information on the platform, so it’ll take me some time to be comfortable using it. It’s allowed me to look into what topics I could potentially consider (and not consider) as a future career, and I hope to use the platform more.

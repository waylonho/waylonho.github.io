## Artificial Intelligence

Software engineering has always been this weird world I wanted to learn more about. Now, as a college student getting his introduction into the field, I realize just how many different paths lie in front of me. Software engineering is an extremely diverse industry with interesting experiences everywhere. Honestly, at this point, I’m not sure about what I want to pursue specifically in the field. For a lot of people, including myself, that process takes time and will eventually fall into place. However, one of my personal interests in software engineering is artificial intelligence. I’ve always loved learning about psychology and seeing how humans interact with software, and AI directly connects the human brain to software and code. The possible applications of this technology are enormous with other related industries like robots and automation. I believe it could become an integral part of all our lives one day, and I look forward to learning more about it.

## Video Games

I also absolutely love video games. Growing up with them as a kid, I want to learn more about how video game developers collaborate and publish a game. Things like character models and animation need code to operate, and the field is growing rapidly. I’d also learn a lot in a team environment that’s working to create this big product at the end and maintaining it. Video games always seem to occupy my freetime, and I hope I’m able to learn more about the industry in the future.

## Working With Others

Last but not least, I want to learn more about working with others in the software engineering space. Talking and interacting with fellow classmates, especially during covid, was pretty difficult. As things shift towards a new normalcy, I look forward to working with other students. Seeing how other people approach an idea helps me learn new ways to see a problem. Also, coding with others is fun. It makes the process a whole lot easier and life entertaining. Whether it be for coding or working in general, having people to bounce ideas off of benefits everyone.

## Side Thoughts about Learning

Zooming out a little, I want to learn what Software Engineering is all about. Prior to Software Engineering, I came from a different college on the pre-pharmacy track. During covid, I did a complete 180° to computer science, and even though I’m not studying pre-pharm anymore, I learned a lot from being around the people in the industry. I hope to do the same with software engineering, wherever I go. I’m only just starting out, and there’s so much more to learn.

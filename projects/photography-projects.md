Besides coding and computer science, photography has been a hobby of mine ever since high school. I love taking pictures and have been fortunate to have multiple oppurtunities to get involved with a larger project and work with other fellow photographers. The art has given me a chance to capture the world around me and share it with others in a unique way. My photography style could be described as somewhat surreal, and I enjoy showcasing the mysteriousness in everyday objects that we usually see in a specific way. 

I will keep all of my photography doings and projects on this page and add more sections in the future. Most of these projects were done in person and using physical materials, but I will try to display them as accurately on a text medium. I hope this page shows people a more artistic, creative side to me as a person. 

##Photography Book

I was very fortunate in being able to work with [Minny Lee](https://www.minnylee.com/) to create my very own photography book. She specializes in making small, personal photography books, and it was the first time I got collaborate with a professional book maker who does it as a job.

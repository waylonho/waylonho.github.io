Sessh is a web application for musicians to sign up, input their preferred instruments and genres, and connect with other fellow musicians to play music. The application was a group project for a software engineering class, and my group really wanted to do something that people could actually use. We wanted to try make a website that felt simple yet effective for connecting musicians.

The program was coded using IntelliJ IDEA over the span of about three weeks.

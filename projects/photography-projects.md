Besides coding and computer science, photography has been a hobby of mine ever since high school. I love taking pictures and have been fortunate to have multiple oppurtunities to get involved with a larger project and work with other fellow photographers. The art has given me a chance to capture the world around me and share it with others in a unique way. My photography style could be described as somewhat surreal, and I enjoy showcasing the mysteriousness in everyday objects that we usually see in a specific way. 

I will keep all of my photography doings and projects on this page and add more sections in the future. Most of these projects were done in person and using physical materials, but I will try to display them as accurately on a website medium. I hope this page shows people a more artistic, creative side to me as a person. 

## Photography Book

I was very fortunate in being able to work with [Minny Lee](https://www.minnylee.com/) to create my very own photography book. She specializes in making small, personal photography books, and it was the first time I got collaborate with a professional book maker who does it as a job. She was a guest artist and helped me, along with five other classmates, design, print, and assemble our own hardcover books. The project took around a month with many late night work sessions in the photo lab. I was able to experience the often overlooked amount of thought that goes into something as simple as a book. The layout of each page, the theme, the cohesiveness of one section working with another, the physical printing and cover design. Everything had a great amount of thought put into it, and ultimately, we came out with a finished product (similar to software engineering, I suppose). The school subsidized the cost of all the materials and printing, but in the future, I hope to do some form of photography book project again.

I will add more pictures of the projects in the future. Still a work in progress, sorry!

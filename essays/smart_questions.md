In the modern age of technology, information about nearly everything can be found with a quick Google search. Anyone can look up a detailed timeline for history, a recipe for cooking, or a specific brand for shopping. We live with a huge database of information accessible with our fingertips. In computer science, the internet provides a hugely beneficial platform for coders to share ideas about programming. If you’ve ever forgotten the syntax for a certain language, a quick search will show you 10 different ways to fix it, and the amount of questioning, especially in programming languages, is incredible. However, there are good and bad ways to ask such questions, and just because we can figure everything out in a few seconds, doesn’t mean we should depend on this resource. Asking good questions plays an important role for software engineers. It’s the backbone of how proper learning and discussion happens. Furthermore, asking good questions promotes good discussion. Talking with others who know the material helps you learn in a new way, and chances are, someone else probably wonders about the same question. Asking smart questions benefits everyone along the process.

## The Good

Now, let’s look at a smart question...

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work/111111#111111 ">Smart Question</a>

 This person could have looked up other information elsewhere online, but it appears they still did their own research. They provided context and specifications about what they really wanted to know more about and even gave a link to what didn’t help them. A more open-ended question about larger concepts allows others to answer with longer solutions. We can see the comments having much more informative discussions. People who have similar questions are able to read, learn, and understand the concept to a new level. Overall, when someone asks a smart question, it gives people the chance to learn something new.

## The Bad

Of course, there’s tons of bad questions that have been asked in the past. We are all guilty of it at some point in our lives, where we just wanted to figure out the right code for something to work and all it took was a copy and paste. Perhaps it was the frustration of wanting to get the code over with or just silly syntax that made absolutely no sense. Here’s a question from someone who seemed to do just that:

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70887147/does-anyone-know-how-to-correct-this-code/70887196#70887196/111111#111111 ">Not Smart Question</a>

First, the title is typed in all lowercase letters. Second, the person simply copied and pasted the code into the question and asked very generally how to correct it. Perhaps this person wanted to understand a little more about this segment of code, but they could have come up with a more indepth question. Additional information about the error given, some questions about variables, something more than just the code. This helps others contribute meaningfully to the topic instead of a quick fix. More people viewing the question can learn from what more experienced programmers have to say. Furthermore, it is possible that the person could have found the format with a quick search on printing variables to the console. All of these reasons combined makes this a question that could use a little more thought.

In conclusion, questions help us grow as software engineers. Learning to ask smart questions can make your journey a lot more interesting and fun, not just for you but for everyone involved.

There’s a saying I heard a while back that went something along the lines of: “Good design is recognized, great design is natural”. I never really understood the larger meaning to this saying until I recently started learning Semantic UI. My prior experience with web design and UI was only a small chunk of basic HTML. Upon hearing that we’d be learning more about HTML and CSS, I was expecting a good challenge but nothing I couldn’t pick up somewhat easily. After all, HTML was all tags and CSS was some descriptions for those tags, so this “Semantic UI” couldn’t be that hard…

## The Frustrations of Semantic UI (and UI)

I couldn’t have been any more wrong. It’s only been a week since I’ve begun, and Semantic UI really feels like a different programming language. In fact, web design feels like a different programming language in the sense that you need to look at your goal and approach it differently. I had no idea I could get so frustrated with all the intricacies of this framework. The amount of times I’ve stared at a result I was trying to recreate is beyond countable, and sometimes, you just wonder if it’s even possible to make a certain aspect of a page. Specifically for Semantic UI, the most frustrating part has to do with knowing the “vocabulary” and playing around with the style. By “vocabulary”, I mean knowing the stuff. Simple things like how to make lines, boxes, different label variations, etc. It felt like learning to drive a completely different vehicle after only having driven a car. Getting the hang of using basic phrases, then using other common words to alter those basics still trips me up sometimes. In addition to being really unfamiliar with the vocabulary, I wasn’t used to how many divs and classes there were. Just looking at past code I had written, I could easily get lost because of the divs within divs within divs within more divs, and I had to carefully track down which style changed which div for every style change. Undoubtedly, Semantic UI has its benefits. However, I can definitely say that, personally, learning the rules of this language has been frustrating.

## The Wonders of Semantic UI

Now, let’s talk a little bit about the good. Semantic UI has a wonderfully simple way to make parts of a website fit together and work. A lot of the wording makes sense once you get the meaning of them down, and there’s lots of overlap between alterations of one type of element and other elements. When Semantic UI works, it’s a beautiful thing sent from the heavens, and it deserves a lot of praise. Even though I struggled a bit learning it, I now know that I can put together a pretty nice looking website if I need to. Additionally, the styling and divs taught me a lot about how a web browser interacts with the code for a page. Elements like a dropdown menu and a background image have so much more behind the scenes than I thought, and I understand that realm of web design now.

Also, the possibilities are endless. Sure, HTML and CSS can take you very far, but having any UI framework is like having a new pair of running shoes. There's so many more tools at your disposal, and it makes the pieces of the puzzle fall into place much easier. You can work with a lot more elements in ways that would take raw HTML and CSS styling much more time. UI frameworks enable you to do what you want to do in HTML more effectively.

## A Newfound Appreciation

Finally, I want to circle back to the saying in the beginning. Zooming out, I now appreciate web designers and the beauty behind good design. There are people that make their entire careers off of making a website look so good that you don’t even think about it. In the same way that a really good movie doesn’t feel like it’s behind a screen, a well thought out and executed design is a work of art. There’s something special that connects to you, me, or anyone on the internet whenever we interact with a website design, and someone somewhere in the world specifically accounted for every part of the user experience. Learning about Semantic UI and UI design in general has given me a new sense of appreciation for the way we see websites.

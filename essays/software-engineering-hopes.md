## First Impressions of JavaScript

	Software engineering has always been this weird world I wanted to learn more about. Now, as a late college student getting his introduction into the field, I 
  realize just how many different paths lie in front of me. Software engineering is an extremely diverse industry with interesting experiences everywhere. 
  One of my personal interests in software engineering is artificial intelligence. I’ve always loved learning about psychology and seeing how humans interact with 
  software, and AI is essentially mimicking a human brain with code. The possible applications of this technology are enormous with other connected industries 
  like robots and automation. I believe it could become an integral part of all our lives one day.

	I also absolutely love video games. Growing up with them as a kid, I want to learn more about how video game developers work together and publish a game. 
  I also think I’d like the environment of working with a team to create this big product at the end and maintaining it. Video games always seem to occupy
  my freetime, and I’d like to learn more about that software.

Last but not least, I want to learn more about working with others in the software engineering space. Talking and interacting with fellow classmates, especially 
during covid, was pretty difficult. As things are shifting towards a new normalcy, I look forward to working with other students. Seeing how other people approach 
an idea helps me learn new ways to see a problem. Also, coding with others is fun. It makes the process a whole lot easier, more fun, and beneficial. 

Zooming out a little, I want to learn what Software Engineering is all about. Prior to Software Engineering, I came from a different college on the pre-pharmacy track. 
During covid, I did a complete 180 to computer science, and even though I’m not studying  pre-pharm anymore, I learned a lot from being around the people in the industry. 
I hope I’m able to learn even more about computer science and software engineering.

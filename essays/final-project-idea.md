## Overview

The problem: UH Manoa students listen to many different kinds of music throughout the day. Ranging from study music, to workout music, to relaxing music, sometimes we want to discover new music from our peers but never get the chance to share our favorite artists and genres. 

The solution: UHM Tunes (thinking of a better name) would be a social hub where students can register for a profile and share their music tastes. This profile will also have options to share outside music platforms for people to visit. Users can also browse a main page where they can see what kinds of music other users' profiles have. 

## Approach

The home page will allow users to create an account. They can then input all their information along with their favorite artists, albums, and music. They can go to a main page where other users' profiles can be filtered. 

The browse page will have multiple fields that show the other common artists people follow, general genres of music, and a filter menu where the user can organize the profiles however they want.

Students can log into their profiles and change their preferences at anytime.

Admins can edit student profiles and remove any innappropiate profiles.

<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
  <li>Browse Music Page (can filter by artist, genre, etc.)</li>
  <li>Admin Page</li>
  <li>Student Profile Page</li>
  <li>Edit Your Profile Page</li>
</ul>

## Use Case Ideas

<ul>
  <li>User goes to landing page, creates a profile, and inputs their music information.</li>
  <li>User goes to landing page, goes to the Browse Music page, clicks on a student's profile to view.</li>
  <li>An admin logs onto the site and filters the student profile by artists.</li>
  <li>User logs in, clicks on another student's profile, and tries to view their outside profile (Spotify, Apple Music)</li>
</ul>

## Beyond the Basics

I'm not exactly sure how to implement some of the slightly more complicated idea, but these ideas could possibly be an extention of the student profiles.

<ul>
  <li>Be able to rate, review, and read about albums others have listened to.</li>
  <li>Be able to comment on others' profiles.</li>
  <li>Display favorite songs and albums from a particular artist on your profile.</li>
</ul>

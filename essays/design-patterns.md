When we think about “design”, we often picture graphic concepts. Things like nicely spaced house designs, or website designs, or cool shirt designs. However, design exists in every corner of everything in daily life. Every process that any human uses to accomplish a task has been designed to be that way overtime, and that design process will continue to evolve in the future for as long as we exist. In coding, understanding design patterns is essential to understanding your code. Getting a general concept, then following a structured framework to solving said problem, is what software is all about. Design patterns help computer programmers to efficiently solve everyday problems.

## Design Runs The World

First, what even is a “design pattern”? Simply put, it’s a way to organize / structure code that is repeatable to some degree. In the same way that people recognize different forms of math problems and find a solution using a known method, design patterns exist so that there’s a repeatable way of solving coding problems. For example, let’s say there’s a math problem about someone buying X apples, Y oranges, and Z bananas from the grocery shop, and you are tasked with figuring out how much money the customer ends up spending on everything. The most common and efficient design pattern would be something along the lines of: 1. Find out how much of a certain product the customer has. 2. Find out how much each of that product costs. 3. Multiple the price of product times the amount of product. 4. Repeat for all the products and sum them up to get a total cost.

That’s essentially what a design pattern is. It’s a known way of solving problems that programmers (and anybody else) can use. Usually, they’re concepts that are more “big picture” and require zooming out a little. It can be specific code or steps that are implemented, or it can be a different way of looking at a particular code. Although design patterns are mainly talked about for code, they exist everywhere in the world around us. The way our city streets are set up, banks record information, and companies manage their employees are all results of design patterns. 

## My Experience With Design Patterns

Personally, I hadn’t thought too much about design patterns until recently. However, the deeper I look, the more I realize that design patterns have been around me this whole time. In fact, every programmer relies on design patterns without even knowing it. For ICS 314, my class is currently doing group projects, and I was assigned to make a social music hub platform. This allowed my group  to use the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. The backend database has a “model”, which is where all the information about the user’s profile is stored, while the user sees a “view”, a nice UI that shows the necessary information in a visually appealing manner. When the user wants to change their profile details, they interact with the controller, which changes the model, which changes the view. This type of structure and organization is perhaps the most common design pattern in coding, especially for any sort of web application where the user interacts with a database somewhere. 

## Some Closing Thoughts

Learning about design patterns has given me a new sense of appreciation for why we do things the way we do things. Often, I find myself just using code that I know works without really thinking about why it works that way. Design patterns have allowed programmers to come up with efficient models to solve problems, and I hope I’m able to learn more about them in the future.

The common saying that “professionals have standards” is actually hidden among many aspects of daily life. As human beings, we measure things in standards. We have living standards, testing standards, social standards, etc. In the coding community, we have coding standards. I’ve recently had a large emphasis on learning and sticking to coding standards, specifically ESLint with IntelliJ IDE, and although I’m still getting used to it, I can definitely see the benefits to following a strict coding standard. 

## Why We Need Standards

First, why do we even need coding standards? Everybody codes differently and to their own rhythm, so what actual benefits do coding standards bring? I’ve often thought that if a code compiles and works, it’s a good piece of code. However, I see it as learning the language of math. Learning certain ways to approach a coding problem is similar to learning patterns to approach a math problem. Coding standards are the equivalent to how you show that methodology in an organized way. One should always solve an equation systematically, always making sure variables are written with proper notation and numbers are in the right order. For me, there’s the important set up before the problem, the work, and a concise answer. That is what a program like ESLint is trying to set up. There should be proper ways to initialize variables, space out functions, and write arithmetic expressions, just like there are proper ways to set up a math problem.

## Long Term Benefits

Additionally, it’s easier to learn with consistency. It takes time to get used to, but eventually, the brain will format code in a readable, navigable format. Learning new syntaxes and functions will fall into this framework, and the whole process is easier to find problems in. It’s always a headache when you ask someone to show their work in math, and they proceed to jump around the page, adding on this side, rearranging variables, and doing all sorts of illegal number wizardry. It’s the same in code, and having readable code makes the world a much better place. 

## My Personal Feelings

I am still actively learning about ESLint with IntelliJ, and admittedly, it’s a pain in the butt sometimes. I can write perfectly functional code that does what I expected how I expected, but ESLint will still give it a red checkmark with 10 different formatting issues. It’s usually small errors like a missing space between brackets or expressions, but it does indeed get tedious. The green checkmark that results from fixing these errors offers mental satisfaction, but it is often not enough to fully outweigh the pain. However, that is ESLint’s job. Overtime, I know that it will slowly change the way I organize my code, and it will make just a little more sense to whoever reads it. Again, it’s an active learning experience, but I am looking forward to being a more organized coder.

When I first registered for a software engineering class, I was completely unsure of myself. The idea of getting a real glimpse as to how to make software in a semi-professional environment seemed interesting and scary at the same time. I’d known how to code prior to this, but this was going to be a much deeper dive. Now, as I come to the end of the semester, I look back and see everything that we’ve covered. There were concepts that I really enjoyed, really hated, and others that I had mixed emotions about.

## The Whole Shabang

First, let’s talk about software engineering as a whole. Honestly, prior to the class, I didn’t really know what it meant. And I still don’t exactly know. It’s more of a general image that I see slightly more clearly now. It’s a way of thinking and interacting with others, and it goes hand in hand with coding. Knowing how to be a good coder is obviously valuable, but working on code as a team is an entirely different story. I now realize that software engineering has a lot more to do with people’s skills than I thought. Skills like being able to explain code quickly and coherently, being able to assign roles for separate issues, and making sure that everybody is on the same page were never situations I’d imagined. Additionally, everybody codes slightly differently, and during my group’s final project, we had to make sure we understood each other to add on to each other. It’s not just being good at coding and knowing how to use the tools.

## Standards Are Annoying... But Important

Among the topics that we covered, a couple really stuck with me. First, coding standards. Prior to the class, coding standards were in the background of my mind as a programmer. I knew that neat syntax and organization were important, but it took me a while to see the bigger picture. Having coding standards to follow and keeping your code consistent not only helps you understand the code better, but also lets people follow your train of thought easier. If everybody follows and holds themselves to higher coding standards, the entire process moves along smoother. It goes beyond just the code as it’s a habit that should be considered in every field. Admittedly, it was very tedious in the beginning getting errors for simple spaces. In the end, coding standards made me a much better programmer.

## Feeling Lost

Another difficult but valuable concept I learned was Agile Project Management, specifically using github in a group project setting. APM is a system for developing any application where the system is slowly built, implemented, and tested throughout the process. The developers are always pushing changes, updating the live version of the application. I didn’t have much experience (or any really) with using a platform like github, and when we first started doing group projects, I felt quite overwhelmed. There were multiple project boards with issues all listed out. The code was constantly changing, schemas were being edited along with their respective methods, and all the while I was used to working in my own environment where I made all the changes. The entire system just felt very foreign to me. I’m more comfortable with APM now, but it took basically the entire semester to adapt to that new system of coding. I found the idea of always getting outside feedback to be really useful. There were times where a concept made sense to us, but when we implemented and tested said concept, the average user found it confusing. Zooming out, APM really is about a system that works with others. Making sure that everybody knew what everybody else was doing and working together is the essence of APM.

## How I Feel About Software Engineering Now

In the end, I learned that software engineering has more creativity than I thought. There’s a lot more behind the scenes than is shown, and when people say they are a “software engineer”, it really means a million different things. It means that person could be dealing with project management, coding, testing, implementing, or anything and everything else along that entire process. I found parts of the process that, personally, I really disliked and wouldn’t want to do again. At the same, this class has helped me figure out my way and what I want to do in the future just a little more.

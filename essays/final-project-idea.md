## Overview

The problem: UH Manoa students listen to many different kinds of music throughout the day. Ranging from study music, to workout music, to relaxing music, sometimes we want to discover new music from our peers but never get the chance to share our favorite artists and genres. 

The solution: UHM Tunes (thinking of a better name) would be a social hub where students can register for a profile and share their music tastes. This profile will also have options to share outside music platforms for people to visit. Users can also browse a main page where they can see what kinds of music other users' profiles have. 

## Approach

The home page will allow users to create an account. They can then input all their information along with their favorite artists, albums, and music. They can go to a main page where other users' profiles can be filtered. 

<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
  <li>Browse Music Page (can filter by artist, genre, etc.)</li>
  <li>Admin Page</li>
  <li>Student Profile Page</li>
  <li>Edit Your Profile Page</li>
</ul>
